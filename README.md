# GenAI Audio Insights

Harness the power of Generative AI and AWS services to extract meaningful insights from audio content. This project combines audio processing techniques with state-of-the-art language models to transcribe, analyze, and interpret audio data.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔊 Audio denoising using advanced noise reduction algorithms
- 🗣️ Speech-to-text conversion with AWS Transcribe
- 🌐 Multi-language support and entity recognition via AWS Comprehend
- 🧠 AI-powered information extraction using AWS Bedrock and LangChain
- ☁️ Seamless integration with AWS S3 for scalable storage

## 🚀 What Makes This Project Special

GenAI Audio Insights goes beyond simple transcription. By leveraging the power of large language models, it can:

- Summarize key points from audio content
- Extract actionable insights and recommendations
- Identify trends and patterns in spoken content
- Generate follow-up questions or discussion points
- Provide context-aware translations and explanations

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- AWS account with permissions for S3, Transcribe, Comprehend, and Bedrock
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials
- Curiosity and enthusiasm for AI-powered audio analysis!

## 🏗️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genai-audio-insights.git
   cd genai-audio-insights
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Create a `config.json` file with your AI prompt template:
   ```json
   {
     "bedrock_prompt": "Analyze the following transcribed audio and provide key insights: {text}"
   }
   ```

2. Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured.

## 🎯 Usage

Unleash the power of AI on your audio files:

```
python audio_insights.py input_audio.wav output_audio.wav your-bucket-name
```

## 📊 Output

Experience the magic of GenAI as the script:
1. Enhances audio quality through intelligent denoising
2. Transcribes spoken words with high accuracy
3. Detects languages and recognizes named entities
4. Extracts profound insights using advanced language models
5. Provides a comprehensive analysis of the audio content
